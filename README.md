# DOTFILES

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It targets macOS systems, but since it has some defensive checks it should work on *nix as well (works well on a few Linux boxes and Ubuntu 16).

## Package overview



## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

Install the dotfiles with either Git or curl:

### Clone with Git

    git clone https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    git clone https://github.com/webpro/extra.git ~/.extra       # Optional, see below
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

### Remotely install using curl

Alternatively, you can install this into `~/.dotfiles` remotely without Git using curl:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

Or, using wget:

    sh -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>

    Commands:
       help             This help message
       edit             Open dotfiles in editor ($EDITOR_ALT) and Git GUI ($GIT_GUI)
       reload           Reload dotfiles

## Customize/extend

You can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
